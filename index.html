                <li>I'm Tony Randazzo and I'm a indie game developer. I studied game development on my own; I started with Construct 2D and Rpg Maker and now I work mainly with Godot Engine 2D and I make the graphics using this same engine, Pixilart, Krita or Paint. I'm also learning Blender and Unreal Engine. I publish games as Big Studio and I'm active on my socials in which I show my projects. </li>
                <li>I'm also a web designer. I studied a little bit of web design (HTML, CSS and Javascript) through courses on Udemy and I'm studying at Infobasic (PE, Italy) to become a full stack developer MERN.</li>
                <li>I show interest in more humanistic fields too. Indeed, I have attended the Liceo Classico (humanistic highschool in Italy that gave me the possibility to partecipate on activities about literature and philosophy) and I played the clarinet for almost 7 years in a local clarinet ensemble that led me to do some masters in mainly clarinet classical music.</li>
                <li>I'm quite good in the english language, indeed I have some certificates that attest my skills such as the B2 Cambridge English Certificate.</li>
